   <p>Handled is an app concept that could change the way we help our homeless get back on their feet.  This design was designed for real world application, and showcases skills with costumer research, wire framing, HTML/CSS/Javascript prototyping, and grid based esthetically pleasing design.</p>

	 <h2>PROTOTYPE</h2>
	 <p>With my knowledge of computer science, I am able to take advantage of creating a functional prototype not just a clickable wire frame but a HTML/CSS/JavaScript model. This allows for much more user testing and more accurate feedback.</p>
	 <p><strong>Give it a try!</strong> <br>
Start by typing any number of characters in the search box and hit the enter key.
Donate $5 to Rick for winter clothing.

	 <div class="content_page">
	 <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
		 <p class="center"><span style="font-size: 48px;">9/10</span><br>Successful Donations</p>
		 <h4>The Task:</h4>
		 <p>1. Donate 5 dollars to Rick.<br>
		 2. Add him to your family<br>
		 3. Look at your donation stats
		 </p>
		 <h4>What I learned:</h4>
		 <p id="Final">Having multiple places to access the menu for the profile will decrease confusion.
People like the feel of a movable slider. I need more security assurance with payment.

 <!--Research-->
	<a id="three"></a>
 <div class="grey_back">
   <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
   <p>Having a hunch will only get so far when thinking of a new idea. The next step is to back it up with supporting data so you can start to think about what features that are involved to create a pleasant and effective experience for all user groups involved. <br><br> To accomplish this, I created two different surveys one for the homeless and another for the donators.<br></p>
	 <h4>QUESTIONS:</h4>
   <h5>Donators:</h5>
	 
   <p style="margin-left: 10%;">What is your current interaction with the homeless?<br>
	 Frequencies of your donations to homeless that are pan handling?<br>
	 How trusting are you when you donate?<br>
	 Do you find yourself thinking about where that money is going to go?<br>
	 Do you want to have an emotional connection with the homeless?<br>
	 How much room for extra apps on your phone?<br>
	 </p>
	 
   <h5>Homeless:</h5>
	<p style="margin-left: 10%;"> What do you spend your donations on?<br>
	 Do you feel as though people don’t give you money because they think you will waste their donation?<br>
	 How do you see your self getting back on your feet?<br>
	 What do you need?<br>
	 Do you want to have an emotional connection with the people that help you?<br>
	 Are you comfortable or have you worked on a computer before?<br>
	 What places and businesses do you feel comfortable getting help from?
	 </p>
	 <h4>RESULTS:</h4>
	 <h5>Donators:</h5>
		<ul class="list">
		 <li>Most people give 2 to 3 times a month if any</li>
		 <li>Location dependent</li>
		 <li>Emotional connection is key</li>
		 <li>Everyone has doubt</li>
		 <li>Likely to give more when progress can be seen</li>
	 </ul>
	 <h5>Homeless:</h5>
		<ul class="list">
		<li>They need to be able to bridge the gap from using money for day to day needs</li>
		<li>Needs: Food Packages, Hair cuts, Rent, Clothing winter/summer, Pet food, Public transportation pass, Mental health and Drug abuse help</li>
		<li>They do know that people are untrusting</li>
		<li id="plan">They feel like society have given up on them</li>
		<li>Having a supporting community makes a huge difference</li>		
   </ul>

 <!--Business Plan-->
	<a id="four"></a>
 <div class="content_page">
	 <h2>BUSINESS PLAN</h2>
	 <h4>Opportunity Space</h4>
	 <p>-Charitable Givers: specifically, people who want to give to the homeless, but worry their money will be used for things like drugs, or alcohol.
	 <br>-More specific opportunity space than gofundme.com.
	 </p>
	 <h4>Value in Use</h4>
	 <p>-Donators feel good about helping the homeless, and experience peace of mind.<br>-Easy set up and retrieval of donations for the homeless
	 </p>
	 <h4>Value in Exchange</h4>
	 <p>-Handled is less expensive than gofundme.com, a flat 5% rate of donation goes to Handled.<br>-Easy to use application requires very little effort to donate.
	 </p>
	 <h4>Value in Distribution</h4>
	 <p>-As we grow we will expand across the major cities in the U.S.<br>-Web and mobile application, allow for wide spread crowdfunding.<br>-There are homeless everywhere, as we develop partnerships we can spread out.</p>
	 <h4> Value in Finance</h4>
	 <p>Financial Projections for First Year:<br>-Revenue: $200,000 in donations x 0.05= 10,000<br>
	 -Costs: Tech for ID card and profile set up 5,000 + 2000 for awareness= 7,000
	<br>-Profit: 10,000-7000= $3,000
	 </p>
	 <h4>Resources</h4>
	 <p>-We will tap into the knowledge and social capital of Desert Industries in order to know how to best help the homeless.</p>
	 <h4>Governance</h4>
	 <p id="Prototype">-Changes may have to be made on how decisions are made regarding who can get a Handled ID once the company begins to grow.</p>
