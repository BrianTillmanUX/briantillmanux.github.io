  <h2>Grid Layout</h2>
	<p>The first step in creating a design is to work on a grid. While this step may seem simple, the finished design will have cleaner geometric lines that are more visually pleasing to the user.</p>

	<h2>Prototype I</h2>
	
	<p>First, Rick needs to add a new vehicle. He selects “search for a machine”.</p>
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_01.png" alt=""/>
  
  <p>Rick cycles though the options, selects the dropdown menu, and finds his ATV.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_02.gif" alt=""/>
  
   <p>Rick wants to fix his broken handle bar so he selects the “damage report” button.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_03.png" alt=""/>
  
   <p>He is directed to a tutorial that teaches him how to use the tools and find the part he needs to change.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_04.gif" alt=""/>
  
  <p>Now that Rick knows how to navigate the environment, he finds the part for his broken handle bar and selects it.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_05.gif" alt=""/>
  
  <p>He is now presented with a price comparison page that allows him to compare the cost of fixing it himself or having a mechanic fix it for him.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_06.png" alt=""/>
  
  <p>Rick chooses to fix it himself because the process has an “easy” rating and is estimated to only take an hour and a half. Now at the “fix it” menu he can see the item and any other current project he is working on.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_07.png" alt=""/>
  
  <p>Using the resources provided, Rick clicks on video tutorial and a 3D walkthrough.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_08.png" alt=""/>
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_09.png" alt=""/>
  
  <p>Rick is confident and ready to buy. From watching the video tutorial, he knows he is also going to need a special tool. He adds the Suzuki Custom Triangle Allen Wrench to his purchase.</p>
  
  <img class="imgFull" src="images/Rockey MT. ATV/Prototype 1/ATV_proto1_10.png" alt=""/>
  
  <p>This completes Rick’s order.  Once his package arrives, he will be able to go back and watch the “fix it” video while he works on his ATV.</p>
